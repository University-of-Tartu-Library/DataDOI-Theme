# University of Tartu Mirage 2 theme


## Installation

1. Install Dspace 6.x normally
2. Place `Mirage2-TU` directory into `webapps/xmlui/themes` directory (located either inside Tomcat or dspace roots)
3. The directory with additional strings and their translations, `i18n` should replace `webapps/xmlui/i18n`.
4. Set up and run a script to periodically update dspace items views statistic (instructions are in `front_page_stat` directory)
5. Replace the `[dspace]/config/news-xmlui.xml` with the provided `news-xmlui.xml` file.
6. Finally, configure dspace in the `local.cfg` file. An example of a basic configuration is provided in the `local.cfg` folder in this repository; a more detailed explanation can be found in the official installation instruction.
